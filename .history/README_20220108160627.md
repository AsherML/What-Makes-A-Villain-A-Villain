# INFO 2950: A Study of What Makes a Villain a Villain

This data science project was a joint collaboration between Asher Lipman, Allie Pultorak, Cianna Chairez, and Carrie Kim for our Data Science class. 

Perhaps no film genre is as defined by its villains as that of the classic murder mystery. Sure, we're introduced to the narrative through the eyes of the detective, but if it weren't for that trench-coat wearing assassin who had decided to do evil then there wouldn't be any story to see. But what is it that makes these villains so compelling? This project uses natural language processing and sentiment analysis to pick out exactly what it is that defines the murder mystery villain. We created a dataset that isolated mystery movies from other genres based on a criteria we came up with as a group: the movie must have an identifiable villain, a committed crime, and the idea that the villain has to be known in some other capacity before being confirmed as the villain. As a part of our data set, we conducted a sentiment analysis on each character's dialogue from each movie in our dataset. It measures how loaded a characterâ€™s dialogue is with each of the ten emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, positive, negative, sadness, surprise, and trust) on a scale of 0 to 1.
